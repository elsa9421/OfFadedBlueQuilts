		<h4> Untitled II </h4>

		<p align="justify"> I'm feeling particularly weak today. I want to ask you how your day went, how you've been doing. 
      I want to ask about the people you care about - these strangers whose existence should never have touched my life. 
      And I find myself wondering how all these unfamiliar people who'll never know of me have suddenly crept into my life. 
      It's like waking up one morning and finding fresh untamed vines that have grown thick while I've been dreaming. </p>

		<p align="justify">Guess I've always had in me to be dramatic. Just needed the right sort of push. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> No, really, watch me go. </p>

		<p align="justify"> I sometimes find myself wishing that you were the person you thought you were. I liked that person. 
      But I have to keep telling myself that he wasn't real. As unreal to me as he was to you.
      Chasing illusions. Or more accurately animated cartoon characters. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> Like I was saying, a weak moment. But, I refrain from asking.
    I don't have the right to intrude anymore. And look, it's autumn. 
    The vines are dying and soon enough with time little new creepers will take their place. </p>
   
    <p align="justify"> And thought wisps will remain just that - thoughts.
      <br> No more, no less.</p>
