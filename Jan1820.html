		<h4> On a Quest for Consistency and bad Grammar </h4>

		<p align="justify"> I woke up this morning only to spend over an hour in bed scrolling through a combination of irrelevancy and narcissism (aka Instagram). I did find a gem in there, though. I have a screenshot of it saved on my phone. I could, obviously go to the room, get my phone, look through it and obtain said screenshot but – will I? </p>

		<p align="justify"> The answer is, of course, obvious and a metaphor for how I seem to be handling my life right now – a lot of very easily researchable and answerable questions left void. </p>

		<p align="justify">
			Where was I? The quote – yes. It was about consistency.
			“Consistency is about waking up every day and doing the same thing until it becomes a part of your very being. And that is what adulting is all about” (Oh? <i>Adulting</i> isn’t a word? Or so MS Word informs me).
		</p>

		<p align="justify"> So here I am, some six hours and half of a bag of Flamin’ Hot Lays later deciding that I will make a conscious effort to be consistent, follow up, and be all round better. No, there isn’t going to be a noun after better – stop looking for it! I just want to be better fullstop – skipping punctuation too. Wow. Rebel, much?</p>

		<p align="justify"> Which reminds me I have a meeting in five and tax forms to figure out.</p>

		Ta-ta! <br>
