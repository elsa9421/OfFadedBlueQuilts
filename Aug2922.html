		  <h4> more than punctuation can express </h4>

      <p align="justify"> i hear your voice in my head. in moments when i want to cave and say it's okay.
      your voice tells me it's okay to say no. it's okay to acknowledge me. it's okay to feel the way i feel.</p>
      
      <p align="justify">i hear you when i'm about to do something stupid.
        there you are checking me before i take a leap. i don't listen, not always. but i hear you.
        "El.." you give me a knowing look. and i know. believe me i know.</p>
      
      <p align="justify">you tell me you're proud of me when i can't stand myself.
      you tell me that i'm right even when i'm miserable. you tell me i'm going to be okay.
      you teach me to be proud of little things, 
      like running for just 20 minutes one random tuesday or cooking for myself another day of another week. 
      it's small tiny minuscule but you teach me. 
      you tell me over and over again until i believe it.
      i believe you. and i'm grateful for this stable mixture that is us.</p>
      
      <p align="justify">for i'm not me. but an amalgamation of you and me . i'm better for it. 
      maybe we all are unstable chemical mixtures of all the people we've ever met. 
      we carry them around knowingly unknowingly. in soul smiles and knee gashes. invisibly visible. </p>
