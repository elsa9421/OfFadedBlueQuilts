		<h4> Counting Sunsets. </h4>

		<p align="justify">It's strange the way the mind works. I can never seem to recall where I placed the house keys and end up spending fifteen minutes each morning looking for them. Rummaging through dressing drawers, closets and even god help me, the refrigerator. But, I remember exactly what I was wearing on a Friday seven years ago. </p>

		<p align="justify"> Seven years. That's almost a decade.</p>
    
    <br> *

		<p align="justify">
			 I remember that I was excited, I was happy. I grabbed a pair of my self designed blue jeans. And by self designed, I mean vandalised by nonsensical doodles. My favourite grey top (which I haven't worn since that day), a black sleeveless sweater, and one of those quaint colourful patchwork bags completed my ensemble. I was ready before anyone else and I impatiently waited for my usually punctual mother and younger brother at the front door.

    <br> *

		<p align="justify">I got a call two years ago. Unknown number. I'm not sure why I picked up. I usually don't take calls with no caller ID.</p>

		<p align="justify"> It was from a friend of a friend. The latter being one of my closest. A kindred spirit, someone I'd bore for hours over the phone and in person. Someone I loved, I still love. Her father had passed away. The friend of a friend's father, not the friend's father.</p>

		<br> A name would make this much easier to follow' , the reader says. 'Yes, yes it would' the author agrees, 'How about a compromise? Let's call her(the friend of a friend) <i> The Kindred Spirit</i>.' <br>
		
    <br> And so it was like so - The Kindred Spirit had made a list. A list of names ,nay, a list of her friends. <br>
    <br> I imagine she sat by the study table one evening, the family's tubby cat by her elbow, and meticulously went through the contacts on her phone. Then, carefully by the light of the setting sun, she neatly penned down the names and their corresponding phone numbers.
    Only once she had finished the task would she pause, crack her knuckles, startling the cat's light doze. She'd find herself mimicking the cat as it stretches it's lithe body. A strange calm washes over her as her room fills with an orange light She's surprised to find that she's satisfied. Correction. Morbidly satisfied. <br>



<br> The list? A list of people that need to be informed of her father's imminent death. <br>



<br> Needless to say my name was on the list. However, it's highly unlikely that my name, like Abu Ben Adhem's led all the rest. <br>
<br> * <br>
<br> I rolled down the car window, and let the fresh air waft in. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned into the back seat and half listen to my mother talking while watching the nondescript patterns fashioned by sunlight reflected off the mirror work on a since long lost patchwork bag. <br>



<br> We were heading to the hospital directly. She didn't sound worried. <br>
    
<br> * <br>
    
    
<br> It was just a wee Pup. So little. He has a nasty bit of bite in him, I'm told. So I'm careful. I observe. <br>



<br> I've see him in action, quick to nip at people but just as quick to soothe with a joke and a sunny bark. It doesn't take much to make him happy, an open window, music and strangely enough a philosophical thought to bounce around. <br>



<br> I listen. <br>



<br> He oscillates between quietly mulling over these ideas to rabidly chewing on the bone. Meaty musings are his favourite. He has fantastical notions and like the rabbit from Alice's Wonderland is constantly rushing through doors. <br>



<br> 'There are four doors', he yaps at me. 'I'll tell you about two of them now.' Like Alice, I follow him through the doors and promptly forget about them. <br>



<br> 'What about the other two?' <br>



<br> 'Another day', he promises. I believe him. <br>



<br> * <br>
    
<br> 'Hurry! This way.' I follow Mama, my brother close behind me. A left at the entrance. Straight through, 10 paces. Sharp right, 20 paces. Left. I lose track. Did we take the stairs? Directions were never my forte. I can suddenly sense that my mother is frantic. My brother and I share a quick reassuring glance. It's going to be okay.



<br> We enter the ward. It's only 10.00 am but the room is artificially lit with fluorescence, not a hint of Vitamin D is permitted through the thick grey concrete walls. Freshly scrubbed pearl white floors meet the dull walls  a perfect right angle. A faint hint of chlorine taints the air. <br>



<br> That's when I see him. <br>



<br> He sits up slowly when he sees me, when he sees us and smiles. Suddenly there's too much sunlight. A smile that is somehow strained with pain and yet abounding in love. A juxtaposition. <br>



<br> He's breaking my heart. <br>



<br> I've been doomed to remember him this way. <br>
    

<br> * <br>



<br> If I ever keep a tally, it'd be true that the number of sunsets I've missed far outweigh the number I've witnessed. And of the few I have, fewer still do I cherish. <br>



<br> A picture, a story and a memory all in one. <br>



<br> The sky was still blue when it began. The unkempt grass lightly scratched my calves. The smell of rain still hung in the air, only overpowered by the scent of wet mud.
A faint sound of chanting could be heard from the woman who held a yellowing paper handbook. The answering chorus constituted even fainter mumbles.Two men, both of them colour coordinated in bright red tunics, lowered a black box down into the freshly dug grave with ropes. There was a slight pause before they began shovelling the earth back from whence it came. <br>



<br> Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Dawn to dusk. <br>



<br> We each stood on the periphery and watched as a daughter held a mother in her arms. Their backs towards the setting sun. <br>
