		<p align="justify"> And so I sat, draped in a bright pink saree with gold lace and waited. </p>

		<p align="justify"> My feet were exhausted. Cinderella had it easy. Midnight. She only had to last till midnight. And after that, she lost one of those horrid glass heels. She probably tossed the other one soon after. I wouldn't have the luxury. 
</p>

		<p align="justify">
			Strange. I can't make out how I feel. A crude mixture of relief and grief. Harsh fluorescence interspersed with glass light chandeliers. Plain white walls enclosing a single wall of roses. 
		</p>

		<p align="justify">  A peal of mirth. The kind that comes straight from the belly. She's happy. I say this to myself. I say it again and again. How many more times till I believe it?</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    
    <p align="justify"> My right fist has been clenched holding onto a memory. A wisp of thing. Of open books and half heartedly scribbled notes. Of a box of food hidden under a desk. Of college wildlife- actual monkeys mind, finding their way into classrooms. Of incomplete assignments and missed deadlines. /p>
    
    <p align="justify"> I've held on to caricatures and crayon drawings. <br>
      I stare at my open palm. There's nothing there anymore.  </p>
