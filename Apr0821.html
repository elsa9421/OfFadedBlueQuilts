		<p align="justify"> And so I sat still, draped in a bright pink saree trimmed with gold lace. My fists regularly clasped the delicate material of my <i>pallu</i>. My feet were exhausted. I knew from experience that the tightly wound gold straps of my sequence heels would leave bruises. Cinderella had it easy. Midnight. She had only to last until midnight. Subsequently, she promptly lost one of those horrid glass monstrosities. She probably tossed the other one soon after. <i>I</i> wouldn't have the luxury.

			Strange. I can't make out how I feel. A crude mixture of relief and grief. Harsh fluorescence interspersed with glass light chandeliers. Plain white walls enclosing a single wall of roses.

		<p align="justify">  A peal of mirth. The kind that comes straight from the belly. She's happy. I say this to myself. I say it again and again. How many more times till I believe it?</p>

    <br> My right fist has been clenched, holding onto a memory. A wisp of thing. <br>
	    <br> <b> 'Of open books and half-heartedly scribbled notes,
	    <br> Of incomplete assignments and missed deadlines,
	    <br> Of empty classrooms and sleepy warm afternoons,
	    <br> A translucent cookie tin hidden under a desk.
	    <br> Of inexplicable giggles on a foggy September morning,
	    <br> Of whispered conversations and long forgotten secrets,
	    <br> Of elaborately planned pranks and impromptu sleepovers,
	    <br> Twisted tendrils of smoke snaking it's way to the ceiling.' </b>
		
	     
    
    <p align="justify"> I've held on to caricatures and crayon drawings. <br>
      I stare at my open palm. There's nothing there anymore.  </p>
