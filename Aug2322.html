		  <h4> Juxtaposition </h4>

      <br> You're terracota pots waiting to be painted,
	    <br> A wholly embroidered craft tucked away in a drawer.
      <br>
      <br> You're bright patterned yellow shirts and clean white shoes,
	    <br> Extra kitchen towels and exactly one bathroom mirror.
      <br>
      <br>You're royal blue fluffy carpets and hard firm mattresses,
      <br>Strong bold baby pink beads and subtle muted greys.
      <br>
      <br>You're a lazy-lie-in-bed-do-nothing Tuesday morning,
      <br>Yet, a bustling sweet savory Sunday marketplace.
      <br>
      <br>You're the light shade of invisible lipstick you insist is too much,
      <br>You're the loud lavender helmet biking downtown.
      <br>
      <br>You're snow storm walks and beach sea glass pickings,
      <br>Sleep-in movie evenings and sleep-late midnight talks.
      <br>
      <br>You're stir-fry-calamarai, cool-coffee-tiramisu,
      <br>And sticky-melting-chocolate-ice-cream filled hot summer afternoons.
      <br>
      <br>You're young marbled leaves and old pink flowers,
      <br>And three-all-in-one different shoots snug in a single clay pot.
      <br>
      <br>You're all the thoughts you spend on others,
      <br>All the hours you spend on beef fry,
      <br>
      <br>You're all the tea you never make, 
      <br>All the things you never say.
      <br>
      <br>You're all the plans I never made,
      <br>All the plans I'll always try to make.
      <br>
