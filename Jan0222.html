		<h4> HBD. I'm An Elder Now.</h4>
    
		<p align="justify"> I spoke to an eighth grader today or rather he spoke to me. 
			And it was probs one of the most productive + entertaining conversation I've had since
    I got here. He gave me a list of anime series to watch and the world seemed bearable.  He spoke extensively of demon slayers, assassins and playing volleyball. 
    His mother bought me a bobble head pug figurine. She informed me gushingly that her son (the eighth grader under consideration) had picked it out and I complimented
    his choice as one correctly does on receiving a gift. I pointed out how he had made an excellent choice as my current wallpaper
     features a pug against a bright yellow background, a pink potted cactus delicately balanced on it's (the pug's) head (I'm easily amused). He, matter-of-factly 
     informed me that he used the first-rate technique of "inky pinky ponky..." to pick out the gift. 
     The methodology being something he picked up from tenth graders who had successfully
     applied the simple approach to receive a passing score in their computer examination."They are very great people" he tells me, straight-faced,
     his N-95 mask preventing me from seeing his whole expression, while I laugh out loud.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"> His use of the phrase "very great" was particularly humourous/jarring (I can't decide. Hm ...inky, pinky, ponky...). 
    <br> He wielded it like a samurai would a sword - sharp, cutting and ruthless one minute whereas true, sincere and almost in admiration, the next. 
    <br> "Joshua is a very great person", the teenager announced at one point. "Joshua has planned out a murder of a fellow classmate."
    <br> At this point he turns and nods at me seriously. "Joshua is my best friend," He explains, mistakenly thinking that the confusion on my
    face was due to my lack of information about the new character, Joshua. "He told me the details of the plan and it's very good. No one will find him out." 
    <br> "Oh?" I say sceptically, hoping that the kid would spill the details.
    <br> "Yes." He reassures me emphatically with no details whatsoever.
    <br> "Joshua wants to join the Indain Army. If he does, there will be no more terrorists." A seamless transistion from point A to E. 
    "He's a v. great person." Conclusion. Repetition for emphasis.
    <br> Obviously, the continuous and aberrant existence of terrorists is due to the inability of soldiers to plan/execute the perfect murder. 
    <br> I nod. Yes, Joshua is a v. great person. The complete eradication of Terrorism being irrefutably a v. great act indeed.</p>  
   
    <p align="justify"> He switches to a lighter topic, feeling I'm sure, that he has thoroughly explored the undoubted greatness of his BFF Joshua suffiently.
    <br> "One of my teachers calls my classmate <i> Chapati </i>. 
    <br> "What? Why?" I ask stupidly. Of course, there could only be one rational answer to that question.
    <br> "Because his face looks like a <i> Chapati </i> haha", he giggles. I chuckle before I decide to be a grown up.
    <br> "Well, that's just mean. How can a teacher say that?"
    <br> "No, it's okay, he's irritating. He keeps singing in class." This justification understandably threw me in a loop. 
    <br> "Er. Wut."
    <br> "Yes, he sings in class while the teacher is teaching."
    <br> "Oh. Why?"
    <br> Short pause. Thinks. "I think it's because he has low self esteem."
    <br> Needless to say, <i> Chapati </i> was hencforth referred to as the friend-who-has-low-self-esteem./p>
    
    <p align="justify"> About an hour deep into the conversation, sometime after he flippantly mentions his classmates' morbid ambitions(ranging
    from becoming an assassian to a serial killer) but definitely before giving me an hourly break down of his daily schedule, he pauses to tell me that he likes
    talking to "Elders" because kids his age don't talk any sense.   
    <br> Ah. I was being lumped into the "Elder" category. But then he goes on to elaborate that that's why he likes talking to tenth graders. 
    <br> An eighth grader's definition of an "Elder" is obviously rather loose and generously applied to anyone older than their immediate peers.</p>
   
    <p align="justify">Ngl, having my EQ essentially compared to a fifteen year old hurts. However, I happily decide to take the comment in the true spirit that 
	    it was intended to be delivered. 
    <br> Afterall, I would like talking to me too.</p>
