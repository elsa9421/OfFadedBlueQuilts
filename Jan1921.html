		<h4> Out of Mind, Out of Rice Or Vice-Versa </h4>

		<p align="justify"> I’m exhausted. And it’s only the second day. It’s not even the nice kind of exhaustion – you know, the one which Julius C probs felt after a sesh of– <i>“Veni, vidi, vici”</i>. 
		<br> At this point, I’d settle for <i>‘Veni’</i>. Haha. 
        <br> Lewd, yes? I am aware. Never claimed this was going to be innuendo free.</p>

		<p align="justify"> Anyway, it's the kind of fatigue, that's permeated deep in your bones after a fruitless day. You've been on the faded orange/brown/(?) - oh, man is this even a colour anymore - couch for hours (has it only been a day?) glued to your laptop, you've forgotten where you end and the damned couch begins. And even after all that transmutation plus an episode of severe leg cramps there isn't anything to show for it! Except maybe this whiney article that will float around lost on the internet before it too sinks and is forgotten. </p>
	    
		<p>Don't mind my bright and ever sparkling spirit. I'll recover and be my forlorn self soon enough. Probs, after I have a delish bowl of rice, <i>kadhi</i> and pepper chicken - yeah? NOPE. If you're lost, I'd suggest looking at the title, dear non-existent Reader. Sigh. I'm being needlessly cruel, but being <i>Hangry</i> is a thing. Why else would Bitmoji have a sticker that says exactly that?</p>

		Happy thoughts, Happy thoughts. 
		<br><i>"To the window, to the wall
        <br>  To the sweat drop down my balls
         <br> To all you bitches, crawl"</i>
		 <br><br> OMG I FOUND A MUG OF RICE !
		 <br> <br>...Er, like I was saying max grateful.

		<p align="justify"> F. Burnt the <i>papadam</i>.</p>
