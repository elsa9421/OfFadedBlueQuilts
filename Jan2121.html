		<h4> Max Productive, Yo. </h4>

		<p> Okay, I had a <b>greaatttt</b> day, which automatically means that this is going to be a shit piece. As everyone knows, the more tortured the author, the better the writing. But, I rather be a happy person with trash writing proficiency than a tormented soul with great literary finesse. *<b>Shrug</b>* I'm a simple person, with ordinary common place needs", I say aloud as I type excitedly into an electronic device that will eventually encode alphanumeric characters into bits that will travel at the speed of 300Mbps through invisible airways - you get the point, we all need high speed internet.</p>
		
		<p> I shall recount the day in extreme detail, so that future me will take note and proceed to DO SOMETHING instead of leisurely  re-reading this piece of excrement.</p>
		
		<p><i>"Woke up, fell out of bed<br>
				Dragged a comb across my head<br>
				Found my kitchen and drank a cup<br>
				And looking up, I noticed I was late<br>
				Found my laptop, grabbed my glasses.."<br> </i>
				Annd I coded, bruh. Don't underestimate the power of brute force. It may not be elegant but it produces results and that keeps you satisfied until the next ugly bug - nah, not going to think about it, I'm going to ride this high until it lasts.
				
		
		<p> Like I was saying a happy person doesn't necessarily produce particularly palatable prose. In other news, a friend commented that she is and I quote, "Intrigued, Interested and Invested" in this little project which makes me-
		<br> 1. Pause, in awe of her alliteration skillz.
		<br> 2. Knows, that she at the very least will find appreciate my a. skillz
		<br> 3. Congratulate myself on having found a gem like her.<br>
		
		<br> Now for some much needed sustenance.<br>
		
		<br> Woot Woot! <br>
