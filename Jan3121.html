		<h4>That's a Bingo!</h4>

        <p> I'm a month too late, but here nonetheless. Ladies, Gents, *insert your preferred Gender Neutral noun* I have an announcement.
		And it is news, indeed. For years now I have rejected resolutions for fear of failure and general disappointment in my ability to deliver.
		But, I am in dire need of direction. Sidenote, I read a blogpost on how goals are just super duper important to making your life meaningful and all round productive. 
		And no kidding, I could use some meaning while being productive. So, I did what any reasonable adult in their late twenties would do - I created a Bingo card. </p>
		
		<p>Nope, your eyesight is just dandy. Alright, alright, alright. You can take a moment and re-read that sentence, if you must.</p>
		
		<p>Each number on the card represents a particular goal I will strive to achieve this year. Some of the goals are simple enough, mostly just to get me through like No. 17, 18 and 19: "Do somthing nice for another human being". <s>Low standards</s> Taking one step at a time - that's the key to motivating yourself, folks! 
		There are of course, some rather tricky items on the list  No. 23, for example demonstrates that there is still some ambition( or hope) lurking about in my groaning spirit, "Avoid processed food for a month". No. 25 is relatively succinct for a goal that's going to take much time, sweat and tears - "Marathon". And the absolute stomper is No. 10 : "Get a Job" - Although, this more accurately will be an Act of God. </p>
		
		</p>In other news, I think I'm into horror movies. </p>
