		<h4>Sambhar </h4>

		<p align="justify"> Mary was from a village along the outskirts of the city. When my much younger self had asked her where she was from, she had proceeded to twist and turn her tongue – a foreign language. The name of the place eludes me now, but I remember the stories. I would lay flat on my bed staring at the slowly spinning fan and would ask her to tell me about her friends from home. I knew all the stories, of course. I knew about her best friend, Rani. I had periodically heard her reminisce. But I liked hearing her voice, hushed and quiet in the night, so Mama wouldn’t hear us talking past bedtime. Tell me about Rani, I’d prompt, what is she like?  Mary would assure me that Rani was the smartest person and prettiest girl she knew. Is she really? I would ask. <i>Yes</i>, Mary would insist. She would then give me proof in the form of awards, medals and general praise that was showered on Rani by her peers and adults alike. I’m not sure why I expected a different answer each night. Perhaps it was my first real taste of jealousy. And besides, Rani was such a pretty name.

		<p align="justify">Mary also spoke of strange school ground games I wasn’t familiar with and afternoon church events that stretched into the evening, of carnivals and food I’d never heard of -<i>’Ragi Mudde’</i> and curries I’d had all my life- <i>’Sambhar’</i>. But the way she’d describe the staple South Indian dish, made it sound like my tongue had yet to taste <i> real</i> thing. Steaming hot <i>Sambhar</i> made with homegrown garden vegetables over a large fire pit. Slow cooked during the afternoon under a sweltering, unforgiving sun. The aroma wafting over the audience as they enjoyed the festivities prepared by the Sunday school children and a rather active youth committee. I agreed whole heartedly. I’d never had sambhar. (Although, more likely than not that’s exactly what I would have had for dinner). But Mary had travelled beyond the four walls of my house, my grandparents’ place and school. In my young eyes Mary had seen the world. Mary <i>knew</i>. Mary had had real <i>Sambhar</i>.

		<p align="justify"> I haven’t thought of Mary in years. The last time I saw her she was in her newly constructed home. There were knickknacks lying about and yet it was neat and comfortable. She had two little toddlers. One she carried on her hip and the other little girl stared at me with wide eyes. Mary chatted happily and informed us about her life. I noticed that she had lost weight. Her collar bone jutted out prominently. My mind grappled with the image I had carried around for years contrasting it with the stranger who stood before me. I didn’t focus on her words; I didn’t hear what she had to say. Her words no longer had a hold over me. <i> Curious, how time makes even the most vivid people fade. </i> I could feel two eyes boring into the side of my face and my gaze shifted again to the little girl half hiding behind her mother’s nightie. She shifted her body further behind her mother when she realized that she was caught in the act, and all I could now see were her dark, little eyes shyly peeking out, I smiled reassuringly. I saw the corners of her lip lift in a half smile. And I idly wondered of the stories the little girl had heard of me. I wondered about the taste of the ever elusive <i>Sambhar</i>.</p>
