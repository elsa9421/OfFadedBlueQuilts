		  <h4> Interlude </h4>

      <p align="justify">Picture This. Not, the Joseph Heller book repeatedly recommended to me by a pepper haired well-read 
        cynical man I was infatuated with for a brief period. 
        But, 'Picture This' as in the image that I will now proceed to detail in the paragraphs that follow.</p>
      
      <p align="justify">The sink of my new (previously pristine) apartment slowly being filled to the brim  with dishes. 
        Clarification : Dirty, not clean. 
        This is not some Saturday morning bi-weekly cleaning spree my mother is on when she decides that the entire 
        family(moi) participate in a bonding activity i.e  clean the already clean dishes.
        Although, I can't deny that she might be on a cleaning spree elsewhere, just not here, in my new (previously pristine) apartment. 
        So, yes, back to the sink. Summary in two words with Capitalization for emphasis: Dishes. Dirty.</p>
      
      <p align="justify">There was one Tuesday many moons ago when the sink hadn't quite reached it's maximum capacity and
        one could argue that all hope was not lost. 
        When, in a sudden burst of energy the sound of water fell like music and scrubbing filled the air with possibilities. 
        The smell of green apple organic dishwashing liquid wafted - danced.
        Alluring like a er... woman who knows (Men are seldom alluring and seldom(er) know).</p>
      
      <p align="justify">But, there was a purpose to the careful procedure. 
        For there was 'Dal' to be made. Comforting, warm, tangy, sweet, spicy, homemade Dal
        garnished with accidently burnt garlic tadka (that, in hindsight was not so terrible) 
        served directly on hot steaming basmati rice and store bought, but v adequate mango pickle. 
        And then, the blissful moment when the first deformed dal-dipped-pinch-of-mango-pickle rice ball hits your tastebuds,
        sitting crosslegged on a wooden chair from the old apartment in the new (previously pristine) apartment.
        Unadulterated Solace.</p>

     <br>All's right with the world.

      
      <p align="justify">Then, the Aftermath. The Kitchen resigns to it's former state of void. 
        And for the Sink? It rests again, stripped of grandeur.
        Truthfully, worse off with a towering tower i.e. Dishes. Dirty.</p>
