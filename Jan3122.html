		<h4> In An Ideal World. </h4>

		<p align="justify"> In an ideal world we would have never met. 
      <br>There would be no heavy lidded light tracing of limbs in bright, harsh florescence. 
      No half empty disposable bottles littering your apartment's hardwood floors.
      No 2 a.m steamy showers followed by reheated overly salty mozzarella sticks that somehow taste better than if they were done right. </p>

		<p align="justify"> In an ideal world there would be no exploitation, although I manage to joke that's it's exploration vs exploitation and I wonder if you'll ever know that I'm being incredibly, horribly selfish. 
      I wouldn't use a three syllable word when a simpler, an easier one would suffice. No walls, no burns, no screams.  </p>
    
      <p> In an ideal world I would have never learnt that I could scream.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"> I'd never know what you'd taste like in candle light. 
      That it's decidedly different than a chilled starbucks vanilla frappe. 
      And a definite delicious stretch when compared to lukewarm chocolate latte, sitting crossed legged on a steadily peeling leather couch.</p>

		<p align="justify">In an ideal world you'd never go looking for autumn scented candles.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"> I'd never learn why you believe gloves are paramount while chopping serrano peppers and you'd never know my quicker way to melt butter on a sizzling hot pan. I'd never know how music with no words can whisk me away to old days with strawberry ice cream fruit salads topped off with nuts. 
      And perhaps you'd eventually learn that I don't have anything novel to offer. Not really. Not anymore. </p>
   
    <p align="justify"> No curiosity, no cats, no curious dead cat jokes. </p>
    
    <p align="justify">In an ideal world your blinds would never be drawn  and light reflecting off the fresh fallen snow would stream into the chaos that is
      your living room. Weekends would stretch into weekdays into weekends and time would stop as snow storms rage through the night.
      Sleepless evenings into tangled afternoon naps into early Monday morning meetings.
 </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> And roomy armchairs with soft duvets would be real but wrong. Restlessness would fill the air. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> In an ideal world I'd never misplace another earring. </p>
    
    <p align="justify">I'd never learn that restraint is an asset.
      That saying nothing is loud. Shrill. It rings through in a way words can't.
      Screams in your ear and eats at their bones. But, heals. And lets you grow.
  </p>
    
    <p align="justify">In an ideal world I'd leave sooner. </p>
