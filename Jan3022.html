		<h4> In An Ideal World </h4>

		<p align="justify"> In an ideal world we would have never met.
In an ideal world there would be no heavy lidded light tracing of limbs in bright, harsh florescence. 
In an ideal world there would be no half empty disposable bottles littering your apartment's hardwood floors.
In an ideal world there would be no 2 a.m steamy showers followed by reheated overly salty morzrella
 sticks that somehow taste better than if they were done right. </p>

	
		<p align="justify">In an ideal world there would be no exploitation, 
although I manage to joke that's it's exploration vs exploitation and I
 wonder if you'll ever know that I'm being incredibly, horribly selfish.
 In an ideal world I wouldn't use a three syllable word when a simpler one would suffice. No walls, no burns, no screams. 
In an ideal world I would have never learnt that I could scream.
</p>
    
    <p align="justify"> 
In an ideal world I would never know what you taste
like in candle light. In an ideal world you'd never go looking
 for autumn scented candles </p>
   
    <p align="justify">
In an ideal world I'd never learn how to finely
 chop garlic and you'd never know a quicker way to 
melt butter on a sizzling hot pan. 
In an ideal world there would be no rehashing 
of hard learnt lessons from people long since forgotten. 
No curiosity, no cats, no curious dead cat jokes.  </p>
    
   
    <p align="justify">In an ideal world your blinds would never be drawn  
and light reflecting off the fresh fallen snow would stream
 into the chaos that is your living room. In an ideal world weekends 
would be longer and time would stop as snow storms rage through the night.
 No rushed sleepless evenings, no tangled afternoon naps,
 no early Monday morning meetings. </p>
    
    <p align="justify">In an ideal world I'd never misplace another earring.  </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> In an ideal world I'd stay.  </p>
