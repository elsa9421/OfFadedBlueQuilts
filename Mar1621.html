		<h4> An Awfully Small World </h4>

		<p align="justify"> I'm here after a flippant albiet accurate assessment by Person-Who-Shall-Remain-Unnamed that there isn't anything going on in this (*Vernacular language alert*)ತಲೆ of mine. PWSHRU summarised my entire world in 1 sentences and I said out loud, "Yes, that's pretty much it." Hey, my world may be miniscule but impossibly full. I should walk around with a sign, "Caution : Shallow waters, no diving." </p>

		<p align="justify"> Wow, my Spotify playlist just picked the perfect song - First Aid Kit's "King of the World" 
    <br> <i> 'Now I wasn't born for anything
    <br> Wasn't born to say anything
    <br> I'm just here now and soon I'll be gone
    <br> I'm nobody's baby
    <br> I'm everybody's girl
    <br> I'm the queen of nothing
    <br> I'm the king of the world' </i> 
    <br> I guess I am an advocate of transience, if there is such a thing.</p>

		<p align="justify"> 
		While, I enjoy complicated plot points, long winding debates/converstaions on history/insert-random-book/film/podcast, I'm a minimalist in life. OMG. This explains a lot about my current work ethic. Haha.

		<p align="justify">Watch this space for something slightly more than absolutely nothing.</p>
