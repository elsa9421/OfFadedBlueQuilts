		<h2> An Act of God.</h2>
    
    <p align="justify">Hey there! 
    <br> Look at me breaking the fourth wall with the very first sentence. How (what's the word ?) <i> forward </i> of me. The point of this piece here is to acknowledge a miraculous something that happened to me. It's important to document, I'm told.
    <br> I am here because I was always always supposed to be here. This is an (as Anne of Green Gables would say) <i>epoch</i> in my life. Will I ever be able to look at anything, if not with rose-tinted shades? For if everything that has ever happened was meant to be, can anything even if incredibly awful have any affect? Oh, death where is thy sting?
    <br> * cough cough *  Er. 
    <br> If I'm not careful I'm going to wake up an optimist or worse, that dog (Mr. Sunshine?) from BoJack Horseman.</p>
    
    <br> Let me try and articulate.
    
		<p align="justify">I'm cynical, clinical, and somehow still whimsical,
    <br> I'm more or less here or there, 
    <br> I'm in shock, I want to cry but I've long since forgotten how -
    <br> I'm happy, I'm sad, I'm anxious, I'm excited. 
    <br> I'm tired but sleepless so I tire myself out to sleep. 
    <br> But mostly, I'm just grateful. 
     <br>
    <br> PLACEHOLDER + REMINDER to future me : Miracles happen. They are real and true and magical.</p>
    
    
   <br> If it can happen to me, the very least of things, it can happen for you. 
   <br> Hang on. 
   <br> It's going to be a bumpy ride.
