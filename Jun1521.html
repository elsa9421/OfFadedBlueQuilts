		<h4> Love Letters </h4>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

		<p align="justify">  You are meticulous, precise and patient and I watch you work with fascination. My short legs dangling from the high, uncomfortable wooden chair. You tell me stories of people, desserts and busy Sunday mornings. 
</p>
    
    

		
	        <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
			 <b> All the distances you will never travel (to the farthest star, to the moon, that new Thai place) are, to you, the same distance. </b>
    </p>

		<p align="justify">A lull. I can hear the dog bark. Someone's switching television channels. You hum a melody in perfect tune.  I swing my legs back and forth and watch the  afternoon light stream in through the frosted window pane. There's a short hiss as the hot iron meets the water you've sprinkled on my pleated, red and blue, checkered skirt. I turn my eyes back to you and watch the vapour rise and dissipate. You smoothen crease after crease, relentlessly.</p>
   
    <p align="justify"> "Don't trust anyone," you tell me, while I nod and wonder. "Not even me," you add, impartially. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> And so, I trusted you implicitly. </p>

			She doesn't know it, but she's the colour Yellow. I remember the first time I saw her, she walked in and everyone took note. The room shifted and I only had to hear her speak to understand why. Her voice carried through with clarity, like a ringing bell. I never heard the words, but I listened.
    </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> Years later she'd still be a Yellow, though, she'd consider herself marred. I can only see the Yellow interspersed with dark green polka dots.   The pattern is distinctive, she wears it with a flair. And yet, she longs for an old, lost Yellow. 
Her voice even now, rings clear, but it's softer, mellow. She tells me a story about an uneaten Apple Pie.  </p>
		
	  
    <p align="justify"> The story begins as they do sometimes with a bearded bloke and a talented artist. The bloke is  irrelevant, nonetheless the artist is enamoured. There is no in-between. It's hard, it's fast. </p>
    
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> <b> 
       Do you love me baby,
          <br> Do you love me baby,
          <br> Do you love me as I love you?
          <br>
          <br> Or do you hate me baby,
          <br> Do you hate me baby,
          <br> Do you hate me as I hate you?
          <br>
          <br> 'Cause I don't want it in-between
          <br> I will keep my feelings clean.
	   </b> </p>
    
         
    <p align="justify">  Blinded by the muse, the artist forgets that the painting is pretend. Until, at the stroke of midnight it crashes down onto an unacknowledged Apple Pie. </p>
    
    <br> *
    <p align="justify"> You write to me consistently through the years, in a sharp precise script. Pages and pages filled with all the words you don't say to me. You leave in the occasional striken word.  In contrast, I'm sporadic and vague, my penmanship ranging from a slow cursive to right out indecipherable.  I outline my inconsequential routine and concerns. I edit and filter and say nothing at all. </p>
    <p align="justify"> Even when there are months of silence from me, you are kind. You don't stop writing. You never ask why I stopped. </p>
    
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> <b> "Nothing beats kindness," said the horse. "It sits quietly beyond all things." </b> </p>
    
    <br> *
    <p align="justify">  I'm tired, irritable, exhausted and yet I listen. You bustle, hustle and juggle. You give and give and it's never enough. You're stretched thin and I'm unable to help. And so I listen, because it's all I can do. </p>
       
	<p align="justify"> Nevertheless, I'm allowed to dream and hope.
     
       <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> <b>
	<br> For in dreams we enter a world  that is entirely our own. 
       <br>Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
	        </b> </p>
    In my wildest fancies, you walk barefoot by the beach, you occasionally stop to wiggle your toes. The loose sand, I imagine would be light and ticklish against your worn feet. You lose track of time, you have nowhere to be and everything to see.  The lines on your forehead are faint, and if I squint my eyes I can barely see them at all. You savour delicious seafood by the ocean, you're unhurried and it's hours before you move to rest your head. There will be no shrill alarm the next morning, but you wake to the sun peaking through white muslin curtains.  </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> The oven beeps and I crash back to reality.  </p>
      
	<br> *
    
    <p align="justify"> I stumble groggily out of bed to perform my morning ablutions. My thoughts are scattered, but I haven't tried to make sense of them. Correction. I <i> won't </i> try to make sense of them. That's why I have you. That's why I <i>need </i>  you. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> We joked, once, about not making the mistake of placing all our eggs in one basket and foolishly proceeded to do exactly that. For, wasn't it you who said, "It's not a matter of <i> if </i> but <i> when </i>". I shake my head firmly. <i> Not Today. </i></p>
    
    <p align="justify"> I miss my clove flavoured toothpaste. It's early. Pot. Water. Stove. I wait, impatiently for the water to come to boil. Tea leaves. As the familiar aroma of spiced tea fills my lungs, I'm subdued. I bask in the morning ritual. Milk. No sugar. And I wait while my mind wanders. </p>
    
    <p align="justify">A memory resurfaces. The bright red water tumbler upon which I'd seat myself. A cup of hot tea by my side. I'd dip a biscuit in and  promptly gobble it whole. It's a game of skill and speed, one at which I am deft. The black granite is cool against my bare feet.</p>
	
	<p align="justify"> I quickly turn off the stove when the milk rises and strain the tea leaves out. My fingers curl around the dark blue tea mug.I find comfort in the warmth. If I close my eyes I can even pretend that I am home for a few magical seconds. </p>
	
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> <b> Home isn't always a place, is it? </b></p>
	
	<p align="justify"> Before I know it, I've sent you a message. 
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">E: Busy?</p>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">S: Nope.</p>
	Ring. Ring. Click. 
	<br>"Hey."
	<br>"Hey!"
	<br>"I have a thought."
	<br>"Tell me."
  <br>
  <br> Forthwith, I plop my bottom on the wooden balcony, cross my legs Indian style, warm tea still in hand and proceed to do so. <br>
