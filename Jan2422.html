		<h4> An Update of Sorts </h4>

		<p align="justify"> I wake up with a clogged nose and a heavy tread longing to get back into my warm bed.
      To wrap myself up again in blue, soft, cosy fleece and let myself forget or at the very least bury everything - everyone deep deep far away. </p>

		<p align="justify"> My nose compels me to battle the urge. 
      I'll be back, I nod at my bed. But not before I grab a purple flower printed cotton quilt to keep me company. 
      I'm ready to face what little I will of today with this, my flowery armor around my bare shoulders. And a good thing too because my first course 
      of action on getting out of the grey bunker is to trip over the blue one seater and land flat on the carpet. </p>
    
      <p> Well, shit. I sniff loudly and stare at the ceiling. Why.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"> Why not, the ceiling counters, unmoved. </p>

		<p align="justify">Of course, I reply.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"> Yes, the ceiling says stoically. </p>
   
    <p align="justify"> 'Reminder : Eat your vitamins', Alexa chimes in helpfully. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> "Achhooooo" x 3  My nose announces, in disgruntled agreement. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> If a pig loses its grunt - is it disgrunted ? I ask remembering a long forgotten question.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"> Everyone ignores me. I sniff. </p>
    
    <p align="justify">My hair smells of burnt garlic. And I'm suddenly wistful.  </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> The ceiling stares back at me densely - unpityingly. </p>
    
    <p align="justify">'Reminder : Eat your vitamins', Alexa reiterates cheerfully. </p
      
    <p> <i> Oh FO, Alexa </i> </p
