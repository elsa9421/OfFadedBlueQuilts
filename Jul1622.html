		<h4> If We Had Saturday </h4>

		<p align="justify"> If we had Saturday, we'd sleep in. 
     I'd wake up to the sunlight streaming in through the leaves, stretch and groan, only to crawl into the sinking twin bed. 
     Tussle for a much too short patterned blue quilt until I'm wrapped in it and you for what will be the last time. 
     I'd stay there, holding on and being held. And I'd let myself be. </p>
    
    <br>*
      
		<p align="justify"> Instead, I watch you pack and unpack and repack.
      We drag things here to there and back again. 
      And I now know useless things like exactly how much you weigh. 
      To the gram. Metric. Of course, metric. I haven't changed that much. 
      The process is interrupted a couple of times. 
      Because we never can get through an activity even if we're singularly focused. 
      That's the way it's always been. That's the way I'll remember it. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"> There's a break, and I turn to tea for comfort.
      It's a forgotten habit but I revive it to cope. 
      A glass and a half of cold water into a steel pot. 
      Fresh, grated ginger, that I made a point to  pick up on my way way back Friday evening.
      When my heart was sinking and I wanted to stop time - stretch the evening light thin. 
      When I both wanted to come back home and stay on that footpath walking forever.
      I knew then that ginger would be paramount.</p>

		<p align="justify">Four pieces of cardamom, crushed open.
      Tea leaves, a spoon and a half. 
      And I wait. I <i>Long</i> .  
      For soothing spirals of spice that will inevitably envelope the cosy kitchen and hopefully, me.</p>
    
    <br>*
    
    <p align="justify"> If we had Saturday I'd want Sunday too. </p>
