		<h4> Something Old, Something New </h4>
		
		<br> I'm blocking you out.
        <br> Your Tears your Sneers your Years,
        <br> Your Wishes your Love your You,
        <br> For all the wrong you did Her.
		<br> You ask me for something I never had the right to give,
        <br> For you gave from what wasn't yours to give,
        <br> Promises and Smiles and Lies and Lies.
		<br> And you look affronted, you play victim,
		<br> But I've seen the darkness,
		<br> Stared at it long enough to know how deep it runs.
		<br> Leave, out damned spot, you're not wanted now.
		<br> In the dead of the night,
		<br> Tears scarcely dry,
		<br> The birds were asleep but you woke us three,
		<br> Three many cooks. But not many, less than less.
		<br> Hot coffee in my hands - I didn't feel it's warmth.
		<br> Leave, out damned spot, you're not wanted now.
		<br> And I see it in me, in how glacial I can be,
		<br> In how numb I've become, slush in my veins,
		<br> Sitting across you - cold tea in my cup,
		<br> And hot, burning tears in yours,
		<br> They runneth over. In vain, in vain.
		<br> Don't you see what you've turned me into?
		<br> And yet you ask. Fester boil.
		<br> Pester fester tester.
		<br> Doth not blood run thicker than water?
		<br> And yet again you ask. How blind. How dull.
		<br> How blindingly dull.
		<br> And now we come full circle.
		<br> Three many cooks. But Three is more, much more than more.
		<br> My cup runneth over.
		
		<br>
